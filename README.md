# Simple-Hand-Tracking-Mode

This project is a practical introduction to computer vision and machine learning, focusing on hand tracking using OpenCV in C++. It's an excellent starting point for anyone interested in exploring machine learning, especially in the context of real-time image processing.

Hand tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves detecting and tracking the movement of hands in video streams. It is a crucial component in various applications like gesture recognition, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. Understanding the basics of hand tracking can pave the way for more advanced machine learning projects, such as hand gesture classification using deep learning.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Tracking**: Detects the hand in real-time using color segmentation.
- **Contour Detection**: Identifies the contours of the hand in the video feed.
- **Convex Hull and Defects**: Draws the convex hull around the hand and marks convexity defects to show the gaps between fingers.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **OpenCV**: The OpenCV library (version 4.x recommended).
- **C++ Compiler**: A C++ compiler like `g++` that supports C++11 or later.
- **CMake** (optional): If you want to manage builds more easily.
